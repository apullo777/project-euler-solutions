# Project Euler Solutions

I created this repository to track my progress and improve my problem-solving skills.

If you're not familiar with Project Euler, it's an awesome platform that offers a wide range of math puzzles and challenges. I love solving these problems for fun and keeping my mind sharp.

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to various Project Euler problems, all written in Python. I've shared them here in the hopes that they might inspire others and offer new ways of approaching these problems.

If you're new to Project Euler, I highly recommend checking it out. It's a great way to exercise your brain and push yourself. And if you're already a fan, feel free to take a look at my solutions and let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements.
